## Software is Language Too!
This is the repository for the SLP (Software Language Processing) code, currently the Core module and others forthcoming.
If you are looking to replicate the FSE'17 results, see README.md in FSE'17 Replication.
Otherwise, to get started with the command line API, simply download the Jar and type ``java -jar SLP-Core_v0.1.jar --help" to get your code modeling adventures started!
